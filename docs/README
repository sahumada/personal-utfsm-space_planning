Prerequisites
-------------

* sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
* sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-spanish

Compile
-------

The Makefile should compile the ps version without any warnings.

To create the viewable/printable document use:

>     make <option>

where *option* is one and only one of:

    dvi --- Will create the .dvi file.  This is provided just for previewing, or if you like more the dvi files.

    ps  --- Will create the PostScript file with extension .ps
           This is the benchmark version to which all other compare
           (e.g. pdf). This version does not contain hyperlinks.

    pdf --- Will create the PDF file with extension .pdf
        Notes:
            1. hyperref may create some wrong links
            2. Currently some packages are not (well) integrated with hyperref so the pagination may differ slightly from the *.ps version
            3. it is possible to get overfull/underfull boxes (see 2.)
            4. it is possible that pagination will vary slightly from the *.ps version (which is the reference format)
